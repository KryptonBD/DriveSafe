# Drive Safe
Road Accident become a frequent inciedent of our life. Due to reckless driving many people got injured and many died.

Due to Current record system all of the incident are tracked in papers as hard copy. So to get the past history of a driver, people have to traverse in these filed and much time waste on this.

As a result many reckless driver got unpunished, roam free and many cause more damage to lives.

Our task was to build a system where administration can track these record digitally and driver will get a warning notification/sms whenever he/she broke a rule.
After siging up driver will be given 500 point and upon breaking rules the point will be deducted.

This project was a part of Hakathon which we've to build under twenty-four hours. The project become the champion by beating twenty-four other teams.
